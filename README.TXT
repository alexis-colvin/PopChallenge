World Population Challenge Answers Version 0.1
----------------------------------------------

This project tested my ability to make basic queries in SQL.
It also allowed me to test creating .SQL files through Nano text editor
and was my first project pushed to GitHub.

A database was loaded using SQLite in Bash Shell. Queries were made about the 
dataset in one of the tables and saved in a .SQL file using Nano. The 
database, as well as the .SQL query file, are uploaded to GitHub and shared.
